# Ebb & Echo

A moderated forum where users engage with news articles by sharing their opinions, interacting with opposing viewpoints, and fostering meaningful discussions based on varying levels of agreement.

All done without AI ;)

Twice a day, three articles are chosen from different viewpoints, which revolve around a common theme. One perspective is chosen to be debated, and users can either send their agreement level, or share their viewpoints via the chat, and hear from another user with an opposite view.
